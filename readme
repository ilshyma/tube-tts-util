```

Example:
```bash

## 📁 Folder Structure & Required Files

Each script file must be placed in a folder with the following additional required files:

```
📂 your-folder/
├── your-script.txt          # Main text script file (input for TTS)
├── config.yaml              # Configuration for voices (per language)
├── apikey.txt               # Your ElevenLabs API key (plain text)
```

### File Details:

- **Script TXT File**: Must follow this format:
  ```
  Title of the story
  _en-0_: Hello and welcome.
  _es-0_: Hola y bienvenidos.
  ```

- **config.yaml**: YAML file with voice config per language (example):
  ```yaml
  en:
    voice_id: abc123
    stability: 0.5
    similarity_boost: 0.5
  es:
    voice_id: xyz456
    stability: 0.6
    similarity_boost: 0.6
  ```

- **apikey.txt**: A file containing your ElevenLabs API key in plain text (no line breaks or quotes).

## 📦 Output

The generated audio files (.mp3) will be saved in the same folder as the input `.txt` file, using the segment keys as filenames (e.g., `en-0.mp3`, `es-0.mp3`).
